# Machine Learning Interview Questions: Algorithms/Theory
Machine learning interview questions about ML algorithms will test your grasp of the theory behind machine learning.

### Q1: What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?
* parameters to tune while training a ML model
* __Bias__ the difference between average predictions and true values
    * Are the changes between the model and reality due to the model not having enough data or is it due to undue influence on the model? 
    * *i.e. is the simplifying assumptions made by the model to make the target function easier to approximate.
* __Variance__ the variability of our predictions (how spread out your model predictions are)
    * If given more data does the model change or does it stay the same? 
    * *i.e. is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change, given different training data.

* __Underfitting__ (overly simplistic) 
    * the model has a bias problem
    * underfits
    * high error on both test and train data
* __Overfitting__ (too complicated) 
    * the model has too much variance
    * models the noise from the input data
    * low error on the training data and high on the test
* __Bias-Variance Tradeoff__ balances the two--increasing one decreases the other.
